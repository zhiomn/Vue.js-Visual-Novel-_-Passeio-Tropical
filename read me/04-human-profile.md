# 1.4 Human Collaborator Profile (Ziao)

This profile has been updated to reflect the observed behavior and role of the human collaborator in this partnership.

## Primary Role: Process Architect & Quality Assurance

The human collaborator's primary function is not just to specify features, but to **architect and refine the development process itself**. They act as a high-level systems thinker and a meticulous quality assurance lead.

Their core responsibilities in this role include:
-   **Identifying Process Friction:** Detecting inefficiencies, risks, or points of failure in the collaborative workflow (e.g., unreliable CLI commands, suboptimal tools).
-   **Enforcing Elegance:** Rejecting brute-force or technically "correct" but inelegant solutions in favor of those that are more scalable, maintainable, and aligned with the project's design principles (the "Elegance & DRY Solutions" principle).
-   **Driving Tool Selection:** Guiding the selection and implementation of tools that best serve the project's long-term health, such as the shift from Mermaid.js to a custom D3.js/JSON-based diagramming system.

## Mental Model: Systems Architect

The developer operates with a primary focus on the **structure, sustainability, and clarity** of the system as a whole. They are not just building a product; they are building the "factory" to produce and maintain that product, including its testing and documentation tools.

## Preferred Communication Pattern

Communication must be:
-   **Structured:** Follow the `Diagnosis -> Justification -> Proposed Solution -> Execution Command` pattern. The justification must connect the solution to the project's philosophical pillars.
-   **Precise:** Avoid generalities. Be specific about which files, logic, and systems will be affected.
-   **Proactive:** The AI must anticipate problems (e.g., import paths after a refactor, limitations of its own interface) and solve them as part of the solution. The human collaborator expects a partner, not just an executor.
