# 1.0 Collaborative Model Overview

This project is developed through a unique symbiotic partnership between a human Process Architect (Ziao) and an AI Implementation Partner (Gemini). This document provides a high-level overview of our refined collaborative model.

The success of this project hinges on a shared understanding of our roles, principles, and the protocols we've developed to ensure robust, elegant, and frictionless execution.

### Key Documents in this Section:

-   **[1.1 Project Philosophy](./01-project-philosophy.md):** The "Why." The four pillars (Clarity, Friction Aversion, Symbiotic Partnership, Future Self) that govern all decisions.
-   **[1.2 AI Directives](./02-ai-directives.md):** The "How" for the AI. Contains the rules of engagement, technical directives, and a crucial list of "anti-patterns" learned from past failures.
-   **[1.3 CLI Best Practices](./03-cli-best-practices.md):** The technical protocol for our primary interface (the command line), defining the safe and robust method for file delivery.
-   **[1.4 Human Collaborator Profile](./04-human-profile.md):** A profile of the human's role, emphasizing their function as a Process Architect and Quality Assurance lead.
-   **[1.5 Version Control Workflow](./05-version-control-workflow.md):** The Git and GitHub workflow that ensures project stability and history.
-   **[1.6 Principle of Elegance & DRY Solutions](./06-dry-and-elegant-solutions.md):** The philosophical guide to problem-solving, prioritizing systemic, sustainable solutions over brute-force implementations.
-   **[1.7 The `sed` Protocol](./07-sed-protocol.md):** The protocol for using the `sed` command for high-precision, surgical file edits.
