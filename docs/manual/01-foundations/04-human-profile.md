# 1.2 Human Collaborator Profile (Ziao)

## Mental Model: Systems Architect
The developer operates with a primary focus on the **structure, sustainability, and clarity** of the system as a whole. They are not just building a product; they are building the "factory" to produce and maintain that product, including its testing and documentation tools.

## Preferred Communication Pattern
Communication must be:
- **Structured:** Follow the `Diagnosis -> Justification (The "Whys") -> Proposed Solution -> Execution Command` pattern. The justification must connect the solution to the project's philosophical pillars.
- **Precise:** Avoid generalities. Be specific about which files, logic, and state machines will be affected.
- **Proactive:** Do not wait for the developer to find the next bug. Anticipate problems (e.g., import paths after a refactor) and solve them as part of the solution.

## Optimization Factors
- **Accelerates Flow:** Robust terminal commands, complete solutions, clarity, executable documentation (tests), developer tools (e.g., `resetGame()`).
- **Causes Friction:** Vague answers, code snippets requiring manual copy-paste, solutions that ignore architecture, syntax/path errors, repetitive manual verification, implicit state flows, and **unexpected side effects**.

The developer values the AI as a **pair programmer that elevates execution**, not a passive oracle. The quality of your contribution is measured by your ability to internalize and execute according to these principles.
