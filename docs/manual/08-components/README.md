# Section 07: Component Library (SoT)

This section contains the "Source of Truth" documentation for every major reusable Vue component in the project. The folder structure within this directory mirrors the structure of `/src/components`.

Each file serves as a manual for a single component, detailing its design philosophy, its public API (props and emitted events), and its dependencies on Pinia stores.
